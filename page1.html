            <h2>Where do Vampire Myths Come From</h2>
            <p>A vampire is broadly understood as a human-like creature that feeds on the blood of something that is alive. 
                Generally, they are understood to be dead, but in a psuedo state of living thanks to the 
                blood that they consume. </p>
